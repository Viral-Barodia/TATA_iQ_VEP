# TATA_iQ_VEP
This project offered at Forage, is a Virtual Internship Program by TATA Insights and Quants. It aims to build a Tableau dashboard based on a data-set of over 500k rows, and using it to gain business insights.

1. In the first task, the company provides a mock data-set, over which I thought of 4 questions each that the CEO and the CMO of the company might be interested in, in order to understand their business direction better and plan for a more efficient future for the customers and the company.

2. The next task involved a few MCQ type questions, which required me to think over the business requirement asked, and which kind of visualization (ex. Linechart, pie-chart etc) would be the most precise to communicate the insights.

3. The third task required me to visualize the given information using Tableau or PowerBI, wherein I chose Tableau.

4. The final task had me explaining all the insights from the visualizations and make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugiJuZIGdoA" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> explaining my deductions from the information and give possible solutions.
